# Retina support

Use retina support to generate high quality images suitable for high-DPI displays. By default, QuickChart serves charts at 2x requested pixel size so that they appear sharp on retina displays.

To disable retina support set the `devicePixelRatio` parameter to 1.0 (see [query parameters documentation](/documentation/usage/parameters/)). `devicePixelRatio` acts as a multiplier on the width and height of your chart.
