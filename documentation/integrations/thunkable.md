Thunkable has a great tutorial for using the [Chart Maker](/documentation/chart-maker/) to create no-code charts.

**Check out [Create a chart template - Thunkable Guide](https://docs.thunkable.com/blocks/advanced-app-features/web-api/charting-apis/create-a-chart-template) as well as [Charting in Thunkable](https://docs.thunkable.com/blocks/advanced-app-features/web-api/charting-apis/charting-in-thunkable) for an example.**
