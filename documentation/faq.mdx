# FAQ

## How can I make my chart look like X?

QuickChart uses the popular open-source Chart.js library, so you can use all [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.9.4/charts/) and Chart.js-related search terms to answer questions on how to customize your chart. If you're stuck, feel free to ask in our [community](https://community.quickchart.io) or [email us](mailto:support@quickchart.io).

## Do I need a license to use QuickChart?

Users of QuickChart's paid versions retain full copyright to images they generate. Charts generated by QuickChart's free version are public domain, meaning you are free to use them for any purpose.

If you'd like to fork the code, keep in mind this project is licensed under GPLv3 and you should make your code public and retain the copyright notice. If you'd like to license QuickChart privately or commercially, or if you'd like help setting up a private instance, please [get in touch](mailto:support@quickchart.io).

## Is this a suitable replacement for Google Image Charts?

This service is a replacement for the [Google Image Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/), which turned off on March 14, 2019. QuickChart provides a drop-in replacement for Google Image Charts documented [here](TODO).

QuickChart encourages the use of [Chart.js format](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.9.4/charts/) over the deprecated Google Image Charts format. Although Chart.js doesn't match exactly with the Google Image Charts API, it is a more flexible, general-purpose charting specification. Both [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) and [QuickChart](https://github.com/typpo/quickchart) have strong open-source communities.

We encourage developers to choose a fully open-source solution over proprietary services in order to mitigate risk and future-proof their choice of API.

## How reliable is QuickChart?

This service (QuickChart.io) is widely used and generates over 300 million charts per month. It is hosted on a large cluster of redundant servers. There is a built-in rate limit of 60 charts/min (1 chart/sec) and 10,000 charts/month for free users.

If you want to adjust rate limits or need a Service-Level Agreement with uptime guarantees, [purchase a license](https://quickchart.io/pricing) or [get in touch](mailto:support@quickchart.io).

See also the [QuickChart status page](https://status.quickchart.io/), which monitors uptime.
